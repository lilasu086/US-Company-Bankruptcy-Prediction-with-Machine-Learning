# US Company Bankruptcy Prediction with Machine Learning
Our analysis involves a thorough examination of numerous feature variables that contain comprehensive information about financial statement indices, from Current Assets to Total
Operating Expenses, which are essential in providing an in-depth understanding of a company's financial health. In addition to this, we incorporate the temporal dimension by including a year column, which enables us to unveil trends and conditions over time. Our primary objective is to leverage this extensive dataset to predict a company's financial stability or its likelihood of facing bankruptcy.
